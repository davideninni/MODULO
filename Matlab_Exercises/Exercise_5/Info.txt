This exercise presents an example of the use of mPOD and POD with memory saving option on a 2D vector dataset.
This dataset is the TR-PIV of a flow past a cylinder.
More info on the test case is presented in

	a Case Study on Stationary and Transient Cylinder Wake Flows

About the data from the from the Tr-PIV analysis: the sampling frequency is 3kHz.
MESH.dat contains the X and Y coordinates (in mm). Each file called Res*.dat containes the U and V components in m/s .
